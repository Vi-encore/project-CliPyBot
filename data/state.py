from helpers.helpers import load_contacts, load_notes

# Load the contact book data
book = load_contacts()  # Initializes the contact book by loading saved data.

# Load the notes data
notes = load_notes()  # Initializes the notes book by loading saved data.

# Logic for notes - initialize notes here, then import where you need it (no conflict).
